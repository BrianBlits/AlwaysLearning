Explaning what are 'Cookies', ' Session' and 'Local storage are!
</p>

Cookies:
- Retain data at the client side for a period of time
- Automatically return to the server on every request <br>
Cookies have one limitation though <br>
- It is not suitable for keeping sensitive data or large amount data.

Sessions:
- Keep temporary data that are shared among server-side scripts for related requests.
